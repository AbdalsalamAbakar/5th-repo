Introduction
The Internet is an increasingly important part of everyday life for people around the world. But if you've never used the Internet before, all of this new information might feel a bit confusing at first.
Throughout this tutorial, we'll try to answer some basic questions you may have about the Internet and how it's used. When you're done, you'll have a good understanding of how the Internet works, how to connect to the Internet, and how to browse the Web.
What is the Internet?
The Internet is a global network of billions of computers and other electronic devices. With the Internet, it's possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone else in the world, and do much more.
You can do all of this by connecting a computer to the Internet, which is also called going online. When someone says a computer is online, it's just another way of saying it's connected to the Internet.

What is the Web?
The World Wide Web—usually called the Web for short—is a collection of different websites you can access through the Internet. A website is made up of related text, images, and other resources. Websites can resemble other forms of media—like newspaper articles or television programs—or they can be interactive in a way that's unique to computers.
The purpose of a website can be almost anything: a news platform, an advertisement, an online library, a forum for sharing images, or an educational site like us!

Once you are connected to the Internet, you can access and view websites using a type of application called a web browser. Just keep in mind that the web browser itself is not the Internet; it only displays websites that are stored on the Internet.
How does the Internet work?
At this point you may be wondering, how does the Internet work? The exact answer is pretty complicated and would take a while to explain. Instead, let's look at some of the most important things you should know.
It's important to realize that the Internet is a global network of physical cables, which can include copper telephone wires, TV cables, and fiber optic cables. Even wireless connections like Wi-Fi and 3G/4G rely on these physical cables to access the Internet.
When you visit a website, your computer sends a request over these wires to a server. A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer's hard drive. Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the website and sends the correct data back to your computer. What's amazing is that this all happens in just a few seconds!

Other things you can do on the Internet
One of the best features of the Internet is the ability to communicate almost instantly with anyone in the world. Email is one of the oldest and most universal ways to communicate and share information on the Internet, and billions of people use it. Social media allows people to connect in a variety of ways and build communities online.

There are many other things you can do on the Internet. There are thousands of ways to keep up with news or shop for anything online. You can pay your bills, manage your bank accounts, meet new people, watch TV, or learn new skills. You can learn or do almost anything online.
History and evolution of the internet
The internet has evolved from a US military research project in the 1960s into a global network connecting billions of people. Key milestones include the development of ARPANET, the standardization of TCP/IP, the invention of the World Wide Web, and the rise of commercialization and social media. 
Here's a more detailed look at the internet's evolution:
Early Days (1960s-1970s):

DNS ( Domain name system ) packets and routing 
DNS, or Domain Name System, translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1), enabling internet communication. It uses a hierarchical system of servers to locate and retrieve this information, effectively acting as the "phonebook of the internet". When a user enters a domain name, the DNS system figures out the corresponding IP address, allowing the browser to send packets to the correct server to retrieve the website's content. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. DNS Overview:
Function:
DNS translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 172.217.160.142) so that computers can find each other on the internet. 
Hierarchical Structure:
The DNS system is organized like a tree, with root servers at the top, followed by top-level domain (TLD) servers (like .com, .org, .net), and then authoritative name servers for specific domains. 
Distributed System:
This hierarchical structure allows for a distributed system, with different servers handling different parts of the domain name space. 
2. How DNS Works (Packet Routing):
Client Request:
When you type a website address into your browser, your computer sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver (usually provided by your ISP). 
Query Process:
The resolver first checks its cache to see if it already has the IP address for the requested domain. 


If not, it starts querying other DNS servers, following a path up the hierarchy (root, TLD, authoritative). 


Eventually, the query reaches the authoritative name server for the domain, which holds the correct IP address. 


The authoritative server responds with the IP address. 


Packet Routing:
The resolver then provides the IP address to your browser, which uses it to send packets to the correct server hosting the website. 
3. Key Components:
DNS Records:
These records store information about domains, including IP addresses, mail servers, and other details necessary for routing. 
Authoritative Name Servers:
These servers are the ultimate source of truth for information about a specific domain. 
Recursive Resolvers:
These servers handle the process of querying other DNS servers to resolve a domain name. 
4. Importance of DNS:
User-Friendly:
DNS allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names instead of complex IP addresses. 
Efficient Routing:
DNS ensures that packets are routed to the correct servers, enabling smooth and reliable internet communication. 
Scalability:
The hierarchical and distributed nature of DNS allows it to handle the massive scale of the internet. 

In essence, DNS is a fundamental part of the internet infrastructure, enabling the translation between human-readable names and machine-readable addresses, which is crucial for routing packets and accessing online resource
What is the internet providers
An internet service provider (ISP) is a company that provides individuals and businesses with access to the internet. ISPs act as a gateway, allowing users to connect to the internet through various means, including wired or wireless connections. They also offer other services like email hosting, domain registration, and web hosting. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
What they do:
ISPs connect users to the internet, handle domain name resolution, route internet traffic, and maintain the network infrastructure. 
How they do it:
They use various technologies like fiber optic cables, DSL, cable, or wireless networks to provide internet access. 
Examples:
Some prominent ISPs include Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Spectrum. 
Additional services:
ISPs may offer services like email, domain registration, web hosting, and even bundled services like phone or cable TV. 
Tiered structure:
ISPs can be categorized into a 3-tier model based on their role in the internet infrastructure. Tier 1 ISPs form the backbone of the internet, exchanging traffic with other Tier 1 providers. Tier 2 ISPs typically provide regional or national coverage, while Tier 3 ISPs primarily focus on delivering internet connections to end-u
